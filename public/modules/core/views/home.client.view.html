                        After being out of the horse world for almost 11 years, McKenzie worked with my new horse Juana Bet and I to build our relationship and move me toward my goals for competition. Her understanding of my new horse and her years of experience in the Arabian Horse show world have made my transition back into the saddle deeply pleasureable and seamless!
